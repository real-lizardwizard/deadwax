/**
 * The downloads panel's optimistic overlays.
 *
 * A script for the same reason as speed.sim.cjs and queue.sim.cjs: there is no JS test runner
 * here. It earns its place by pinning the behaviour that makes the panel feel responsive at
 * all - clicking cancel or "clear finished" used to change nothing on screen until two
 * sequential round-trips had completed, so the buttons felt disconnected from the app.
 *
 * The interesting cases are all about the prediction being WRONG or SLOW, which is exactly
 * what is hard to reach in a browser: a cancel the server refuses, a cancel it accepts but
 * has not applied yet, and a cancel it never confirms at all.
 *
 * Run it with:  node ui/test/downloads.sim.cjs
