/**
 * The relationship between the tab badge and the review queue.
 *
 * A script for the same reason as speed.sim.cjs: there is no JS test runner here. It earns its
 * place by pinning the bug it was written for - the badge counted albums the queue did not,
 * so the interface reported that an album wanted attention and then had nowhere to point, and
 * no way to clear it.
 *
 * Run it with:  node ui/test/queue.sim.cjs
