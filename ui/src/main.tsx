 * rather than remounting, so the poll survives switching tabs.
 *
 * The count is deliberately not derived from the library scan: the library isn't read until
 * you open its tab, so a badge that waited for that would be missing at exactly the moment it
 * has something to say. It comes from the rows the poller writes as it files each download.
