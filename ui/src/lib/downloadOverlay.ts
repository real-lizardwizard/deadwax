/**
 * Optimistic overlays for the downloads panel.
 *
 * WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 *
 * Both actions in that panel cost two sequential round-trips before anything could change on
 * screen: one to deadwax - which itself calls on to slskd - and then a poll to see the
 * result. Until both landed, the row was pixel-identical to how it looked before the click.
 * That is the "latency": not that the app was slow, but that it showed nothing at all while
 * it waited for the server to agree.
 *
 * An overlay is a prediction laid over the polled data. The polled data stays authoritative
 * and is never edited, which is what makes this safe - the worst case is a prediction that
 * turns out wrong, and both of the functions below exist to make that case end quickly.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the hook, for the reason everything else in lib/ is: this is the
 * part with the interesting edge cases, and it can be exercised without a browser or a
 * server. See ui/test/downloads.sim.cjs.

 * clearing the overlay on completion would flip the row back to "downloading" for one poll
 * before it finally read "cancelled". Waiting for the server's own answer to match removes
 * that flicker entirely.
