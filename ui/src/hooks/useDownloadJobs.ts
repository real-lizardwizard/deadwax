 * these polls return identical numbers. That's fine for progress - it just means the bar
 * doesn't move - but it's why ../lib/speed.ts holds the last measured rate across quiet
 * ticks instead of reporting "unknown" every other second.
 *
 * Note the speed is NOT recomputed per poll. ../lib/speed.ts measures it over a one-second
 * window and so publishes a new figure once a second whatever this cadence is; the extra polls
 * feed progress and status, and their bytes accumulate into the next window rather than being
 * thrown away. Changing the numbers here does not change how often the speed updates.
 *
 * Each open poll is one request to jimbrainz and, while anything is downloading, one onward
 * request to slskd. Going below ~500ms starts being rude to slskd for no visible gain.
