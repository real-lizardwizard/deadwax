/**
 * Vite root for the Preact migration.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT an HTML build. While the port is in progress the vanilla
 * `interface/index.html` is still the page users get, and it loads the bundle produced here
 * as one extra module script. So the build input is `src/main.tsx`, not `index.html`, and
 * `index.html` in this directory exists only as a dev harness (see the file itself).
 *
 * When the migration finishes and Vite owns the page, drop `rollupOptions.input` and let it
 * build `index.html` normally. See docs/FRONTEND-MIGRATION.md.
