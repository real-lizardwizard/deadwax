"""
Tests for the settings tab's backend.

The endpoint exists to answer "why isn't this working" without making somebody read the
container's environment by hand, so what these tests protect is the DIAGNOSIS, not the
plumbing. Three properties matter and each has cost real time when it was missing:

  1. the API key never leaves the process, however the row is rendered
  2. a path that is set but unreachable from inside the container is reported as an ERROR,
     not shown as though it were fine - this is the most common first-run failure and it is
     invisible from the value alone
  3. an optional setting that is simply unset is NOT dressed up as a problem, because a list
     where everything is flagged is a list where nothing stands out
