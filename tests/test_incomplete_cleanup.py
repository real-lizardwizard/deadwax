"""
Removing the partial files a cancelled download leaves behind.

This deletes files deadwax did not create, in a folder belonging to another application, so
it is written and tested like delete_album() rather than like the organizer.

The thing to understand before changing any of it: **slskd keeps partial files on purpose.** It
stores one at `<incomplete>/<username>/<remote path>/<file>` and, with `retry.partial` set to
Resume, starts the next attempt at that file's length rather than at zero. A leftover is a
feature for a download that failed and junk only for one that was deliberately cancelled - which
is why this runs on cancel alone, and does nothing until SLSKD_INCOMPLETE_PATH says where to
look.
