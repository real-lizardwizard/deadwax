"""
The metadata queue's rules.

Two halves, deliberately:

  Most of it is plain dicts, because metadata_health is pure and its input is the album shape
  library.py already produces. Building real files to test a rule about a missing string would
  be testing mutagen.

  A few go through a real scan of real tagged files. Those are the ones that matter most,
  because the `misfiled` rule compares a folder name against a name it recomputes from the
  tags - and if those two ever disagree by construction, EVERY album in a library gets flagged
  and the queue is worthless. That risk lives in the seam between two modules, so the test has
  to cross it.
