Tests for the library organizer.

This is the only code in deadwax that writes to the user's filesystem, so it gets the most
paranoid coverage: everything below runs against real files in a pytest tmp_path, and the
destructive cases (overwrite, collision, move-vs-copy) are asserted explicitly rather than
assumed.
