Editions - the thing that made a second copy of an album vanish.

The bug these guard against: `{album} ({year})` gave the standard and the deluxe press of
the same record identical paths, execute_plan refused to overwrite, and the poller reported
the resulting all-skipped job as "organized". The album never arrived and the UI said it had.

# ===== alternate performances ================================================
#
# A different KIND of edition from deluxe/remaster, and the reason it matters more:
#
#   A deluxe edition is more of the same album, so colliding it with the standard press
#   loses a few bonus tracks. An instrumental is a different RECORDING of the same album -
#   identical track titles, identical numbers, identical count - so colliding it means every
#   file matches one already on disk, all of them are skipped, and the job reports that
#   nothing needed doing. You asked for an album and got neither.
#
# Dance Gavin Dance is the case that surfaced it. Verified against the live API: MusicBrainz
# holds the instrumental as a RELEASE inside the ordinary album's group, carrying
# "(instrumental)" in its TITLE with an EMPTY disambiguation - so every source
# resolve_edition_label() consults returned blank.
