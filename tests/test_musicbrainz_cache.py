"""
Caching MusicBrainz responses, and what must never be cached.

MusicBrainz allows roughly one request a second, and opening the metadata editor asks several
questions per album - so every avoided request is a second of somebody waiting. The data barely
moves, which is what makes caching safe here.

The load-bearing test in this file is the one asserting that FAILURES are not cached.
request_with_retries returns an error dict rather than raising when it gives up, so a cache that
could not tell the two apart would pin a transient outage in place for the whole TTL and turn a
bad minute into a bad hour - and MusicBrainz goes unreachable for minutes at a time from a dev
machine routinely (it did, twice, while this was being written).
