Tests for the background download poller.

The poller is what actually moves a job through its lifecycle, and it only ever runs against
a live slskd - which doesn't exist on a dev machine. So it's driven here with a fake client
returning slskd-shaped payloads and a real (temp-file) store, which is the closest thing to
observing it for real that's available without deploying.
