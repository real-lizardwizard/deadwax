# Backend and data: gotchas discovered the hard way

Each of these cost real time. Don't rediscover them.

### Backend and data

- **slskd answers a search with `409 Conflict` when it is not logged in to SOULSEEK**, which is
  nothing like what the status name suggests, and it was the first thing real infrastructure
  broke. `SearchesController.Post` maps `InvalidOperationException` to `Conflict`, and the only
  thing throwing one on that path is Soulseek.NET's own precondition - "The server connection
  must be connected and logged in to perform a search". Traced through slskd's and
  Soulseek.NET's source rather than guessed at, because the guess anyone would make from the
  word "Conflict" is a duplicate search id, and it is not that.
  **The reason was in the response BODY the whole time.** `requests` renders an `HTTPError` as
  its status line alone, so `409 Client Error: Conflict for url: ...` is what reached the user
  while slskd was spelling it out one layer down. `slskd_said()` reads that body - a bare JSON
  string (slskd declares `[Produces("application/json")]` and returns plain strings), a
  ProblemDetails object, or text - and `describe_search_refusal()` explains the status around
  it. **Any other slskd call that shows an error to the user should read the body the same way.**
  429 is the other status worth knowing: slskd runs ONE search at a time, behind a static
  `SemaphoreSlim(1, 1)` taken with `Wait(0)`, so two tabs or a retry on top of a slow search get
  "Only one concurrent operation is permitted".
- **Pinging slskd's API says nothing about its connection to Soulseek, and the pill claimed
  otherwise.** `application.state()` answers 200 whenever the container is up and the key is
  right; slskd sits there logged out and serves it perfectly. So the connection pill read
  `connected` right up until the first search failed - and then the *search* took the blame for
  something that was already wrong before it ran, which is the exact failure those pills exist
  to prevent. Same shape as the `peer avg` relabel: a status that visibly doesn't match reality
  teaches you to distrust the ones that do. `ping()` now reads `server.isConnected` and
  `server.isLoggedIn` out of that same payload and reports `NOT_CONNECTED`, `NOT_LOGGED_IN` or
  `CONNECTING`.
  **An slskd too old to report `server` at all is treated as connected** - absence of the field
  is not evidence of a disconnection, and a red pill on a working install is the worse of the
  two mistakes. `connectionWatchdog.isAwaitingVpn` is named when set, because slskd here runs
  inside a VPN container and "it is waiting for its VPN" is the entire answer; it is newer than
  some slskd versions, so it is read defensively and omitted when absent.
  The state string (`"Connected, LoggedIn"`, `"Disconnected"`) is a .NET flags enum and is only
  ever QUOTED BACK, never parsed - the booleans beside it are the contract.
- **`@app.middleware("http")` made `request.is_disconnected()` a permanent False, app-wide.**
  That decorator is Starlette's `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, whose wrapped `receive` has to be awaited
  to learn anything, and `is_disconnected()` only peeks - inside an already-cancelled scope, so
  the peek is always cancelled before the disconnect can arrive. Found when the v0.9.8 abandoned-
  search fix did nothing live while its tests passed (they call the route directly, with no
  middleware). The cache-header middleware is plain ASGI now (`RevalidateInterfaceAssets` in
  app.py), and `test_no_middleware_hides_a_disconnect_from_the_routes` refuses any
  BaseHTTPMiddleware coming back. **Don't add another `@app.middleware("http")`** - write it as
  ASGI, touching `send` only.
- **A 409 costs one extra request, on the failure path only.** `_explain_refusal()` asks slskd
  how its connection is doing, because "not connected, and it is waiting for its VPN" is an
  answer and "not connected" is a shrug. If that request fails too it is dropped silently and
  slskd's original words are used - a diagnosis must never replace the error it explains.
  The sentence it builds is shown in TWO places, on its own in the event log and after
  "search failed: " in the candidates panel, so every branch of it names slskd as its subject.
- **slskd's `averageSpeed` is cumulative** (total bytes ÷ total elapsed), so it only ever
  creeps upward and never shows the current rate. Real speed is derived from `bytesTransferred`
  deltas between polls. Don't "simplify" back to `averageSpeed`.
- **`uploadSpeed` is BYTES per second, not bits.** Two comments claimed bits, which would invite
  someone to "fix" the display by a factor of eight. slskd's own web UI renders the same field
  as `formatBytes(response.uploadSpeed)/s`, and `score_peer()`'s thresholds only make sense read
  as bytes — 1 MB/s for a fast peer, 100 KB/s for a decent one; as bits those would be 125 and
  **12.5** KB/s. The display was always right; only the comments were wrong.
- **Hold a stale rate for a duration, never for a number of polls.** `speed.ts` kept the last
  measured rate across quiet polls (a zero delta usually means "slskd hasn't refreshed its
  counter", not "the transfer stopped") — but it counted four *polls*, and the poll cadence is
  not fixed: 500ms with the panel open, 5s in the background, and browsers throttle background
  tabs further. So the same constant meant ~2s when watched and 20s+ when not. Measured against
  a steady 1 MB/s transfer with slskd's counter refreshing every 5s, **the speed read blank on
  54% of polls**, in gaps of up to 5 seconds — a transfer moving at a perfectly constant rate,
  flickering between a number and nothing. It ages out on wall time now (`STALE_RATE_MS`), which
  put that back to 92% and bounded the lie at ~6s whatever the cadence.
- **The speed is measured over a one-second window, which is also how often it changes.** One
  constant (`SPEED_UPDATE_MS`), not a measurement plus a display throttle — a short window
  quantises badly against slskd's own counter, so publishing twice a second gave a figure that
  was both hard to read and noisier than the transfer really was. Measured on a transfer
  deliberately wobbling ±30%: 120 distinct figures a minute became 60, and the scatter fell
  (std dev 0.212 → 0.187 MB/s) while still tracking the real swing. **The poll cadence is
  independent of this** — the extra polls drive progress and status, and their bytes accumulate
  into the next window rather than being discarded, so changing `POLL_OPEN_MS` does not change
  how often the speed updates.
- **`ui/test/speed.sim.cjs` is the only frontend test in the repo, and it is a script.** There is
  no JS test runner here (adding one needs a newer Node than this repo builds on), and the
  sampler is the piece of frontend logic whose failure is *silent* — a wrong rate looks entirely
  plausible, and "no speed at all, intermittently" is invisible to any assertion about a single
  poll. It compiles `speed.ts` itself, simulates polling against a known true rate, and exits
  non-zero. Run it with `node ui/test/speed.sim.cjs`; it fails on the pre-fix code.
- **An unrecognised slskd transfer substate is a permanently stuck job.** This was predicted in
  "What the tests cannot tell you" below and then happened: `summarize_transfers` knew about
  `"Completed, Succeeded"`, `"Errored"` and `"Cancelled"`, so **`"Completed, Rejected"` counted
  as neither done nor failed**. A refused download sat at `queued` forever — the interface
  renders that as "hasn't started yet" — and because slskd *was* reporting the transfers, the
  unmatched-transfer grace period never applied either. Nothing could clear it but hand-editing
  the DB. Every terminal substate now lives in `TRANSFER_FAILURE_REASONS` in `store.py` with the
  sentence shown to the user. **If slskd grows another substate, add it there.**
- **Never take a word apart to build a search query.** `build_search_query` used to strip all
  punctuation to spaces, so Metallica's **`S&M2` was searched for as `S M2`** — and found
  nothing. If Soulseek tokenizes on non-alphanumerics (which is what the failure looks like),
  the folder `Metallica - S&M2 (2020)` holds `metallica/s/m/2` and there is **no `m2` token in
  it**, so we asked for a term that exists on neither side. The album name silently vanished
  from its own search.
  The rule now: **punctuation between two alphanumerics is part of the word and stays**
  (`S&M2`, `R&B`, `AC/DC`, `Jay-Z`, `That's`); punctuation standing on its own is dropped
  (`Simon & Garfunkel`, `(Deluxe)`, `Guns N'`). Whatever Soulseek does to `S&M2` in the query it
  does to `S&M2` in the folder name, and that is a far better bet than guessing on its behalf —
  splitting it ourselves is the one option that is wrong under *both* readings of how it
  matches.
  **A first attempt got this wrong in an instructive way**: it kept the splitting and dropped
  the one-character debris instead, which fixed nothing here (`S M2` → `M2`, still no match) and
  quietly turned `Vol. 2` into `Vol`. Length is not the signal — position is.
- **A failed releases fetch used to be indistinguishable from an album with no releases.**
  `get_releases()` read `data.get("releases", [])` straight off whatever `request_with_retries`
  returned — and that answers with an *error dict* rather than raising, so a MusicBrainz blip
  came back as `{"release-count": 0, "releases": []}`. The interface believed it. The top search
  result rendered with nothing to expand, and since the filter facets are built from whatever
  release grids are mounted, **an entire search came up with no filters at all**. It now returns
  a `problem` alongside, and says so in the event log.
- **`renderFacets()` has to be called by hand, and one call site didn't.** Fetching a release
  group's releases mounted a grid without telling the facets, so expanding a group left the
  filter column still reading "expand a release group to see filters" — and with the bug above,
  that was the *only* way to mount a grid, so the filters never appeared at all. This is exactly
  the hand-rolled render bookkeeping counted below (29 call sites that must remember). It goes
  away with the port, not before; until then, **anything that mounts or unmounts a release grid
  must call `renderFacets()` and `updateResultsSummary()`**.
- **A non-total branch in `createReleaseGroupElement` produced a dead card.** It tested
  `if (releases && releases.length)` then `else if (releases === null)`, so an empty array
  matched neither and the group rendered with no grid *and* no fetch button — unexpandable, with
  no way back. `processSearchResults` now passes `null` for an empty list and the second arm is
  a plain `else`. Watch for this shape: `[]` is neither truthy-with-length nor `null`.
- **A 400 from MusicBrainz is a rejected QUERY, and retrying it is pointless.** It used to fall
  through to the generic branch and go round the retry loop ten times, with rate-limit pacing
  between each, before reporting "MusicBrainz is unreachable" — about thirty seconds spent
  arriving at the same deterministic answer, and then blaming the network for a bad search. It
  breaks out immediately now and says the query was rejected. This matters more since the
  search view began composing type-filter clauses: a syntax mistake there has to be legible as
  a syntax mistake.
- **`request_with_retries` returns an error dict rather than raising.** Reaching straight for
  `["release-groups"]` produced a `KeyError` that surfaced as *"Error searching MusicBrainz:
  'release-groups'"* — which reads like a bad query, so an outage looked like user error.
  `MusicBrainzUnavailable` now distinguishes them. **This is also why the response cache stores
  only the success path** — caching that error dict would pin a transient outage in place for
  the whole TTL, turning a bad minute into a bad hour with no remedy but a restart.
- **MusicBrainz's own result order cannot pick the album for you.** Searching
  `releasegroup:"Metallica" AND artist:"Metallica"` returns 25 groups of which the **first five
  all score exactly 100** — two live albums, an interview disc, a compilation, and only then the
  1991 album. The editor took `slice(0, 3)`, so it spent three requests on the wrong groups and
  **never fetched the right one**; no amount of ranking the releases underneath could have
  helped, because they were never retrieved. `scoreReleaseGroupMatch` now ranks groups first, on
  group-level signals only (year is worth 100, exact title 40, studio-album-ness 30, an unlikely
  secondary type −30, MB's score ÷10 as a weak tiebreak). Weighted, not filtered — tag the 1996
  live album as 1996 and it still wins, which was verified along with the two Black Album cases.
- **The "rate limit hit" warning was ours, not MusicBrainz's.** `RateLimit.wait()` logged a
  *frontend* warning every time it paced a request, which during any normal burst is constantly —
  so the app spent its time telling the user that its own politeness was a fault. It is at debug
  now. A real 429 from the server is still reported.
- **docker-compose: `environment:` beats `env_file`, and that is now a supported way to
  configure deadwax — but only with LITERAL values.** Both sources work and may be mixed
  (`load_dotenv()` does not override existing variables, so the environment wins; there is a
  subprocess test pinning that, because flipping it to `override=True` would invert the
  precedence with nothing to show for it).
  The trap is `SLSKD_URL=${SLSKD_URL}`: compose re-interpolates that from its *own* env, and an
  empty result **still counts as set**, so it beats `.env` and leaves the setting blank beside a
  `.env` line that looks perfectly correct. That produced an unusable empty `SLSKD_URL` once
  already. `shadowed_by_empty_env()` now detects exactly this and names it in the log, and
  `setting_source()` reports which source supplied each setting on startup — "check your .env"
  is useless advice to someone who configured everything in compose.
- **`.env` values must not have trailing `# comments`.** Compose and python-dotenv disagree
  about inline comments. Examples go on their own lines.
- **Two editions of one album used to silently not arrive.** `{album} ({year})` gave the
  standard and deluxe press identical paths; `execute_plan` correctly refused to overwrite,
  so every track was *skipped* — and the poller only reported a problem when
  `organized == 0 AND skipped == 0`, so an all-skipped job fell through to status
  `organized`. Green tick, album missing. Fixed in both places, and both are covered by
  tests. **This was the exact Lidarr complaint that motivated the fork**, reproduced here.
- **Cover art is fetched on apply, never on preview.** Previewing runs on every click in the
  release list, so downloading an image to describe it would be slow and rude to the Archive.
  `plan_art()` decides what *would* happen with no network call; the route fetches the bytes
  and hands them to `execute_retag`, which keeps `retag.py` free of network dependencies and
  testable without one.
- **Cover art is served with a five-minute cache, so its URL has to carry a version.** Without
  one, replacing a cover showed the old image for five minutes — precisely when you are looking
  at it, since you had just changed it. The version is the **art file's own mtime**, and the
  distinction matters: replacing `cover.jpg` in place does not touch the *directory's* mtime, so
  `album.modified_at` sits perfectly still through the one operation that must be noticed
  (measured: dir mtime unchanged, file mtime moved). `albumArtUrl()` is the only place that
  builds this URL — keep it that way.
  Note the corollary: the scan cache also keys on directory mtime, so an in-place cover
  replacement is invisible to it too. `forget_cached_album()` on the retag path is what makes
  the new art appear; a cover changed by anything else needs a rescan.
- **Retagging a file does NOT change its directory's mtime** — only adding, removing or
  renaming entries does. Measured, not assumed. The library cache keys on directory mtime,
  so an in-place retag is invisible to the scanner and the edit looks like it silently
  failed. `forget_cached_album()` exists for exactly this, and the retag endpoint calls it
  for both the old and new locations.
- **Embedded pictures have a TYPE, and files usually hold several.** Type 3 is
  `COVER_FRONT`, type 6 is `MEDIA` — a scan of the disc itself. EAC and dBpoweramp rips
  routinely embed both, in no guaranteed order, so `pictures[0]` showed albums illustrated
  with a picture of a CD. Selection goes through `PICTURE_TYPE_PREFERENCE`, never by order.
  The same trap applies to ID3 `APIC` frames (there can be several, keyed by description)
  and to loose files — a lone `disc.jpg` is not the cover.
- **`/library/art` was the first endpoint to turn user input into a filesystem read**, and
  `/library/tracks` and `/deletion_summary` copy its guard. It
  takes a path relative to LIBRARY_PATH, so `is_within()` containment is load-bearing, not
  decoration — without it `?album=../../..` reads anything the container user can. It
  answers 404 identically for "outside the library" and "no such album" so a probe learns
  nothing. Covered by tests including a symlink pointing out of the library. **If you add
  another endpoint taking a path, copy this pattern.** And **a guard on the FOLDER is not a
  guard on the FILE**: a file found in a contained folder's listing can itself be a symlink
  out, which is how `/disc_art` served one until v1.1.8. A route serving a file's own bytes
  checks the file resolves inside its folder too.
