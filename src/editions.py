"""
Working out *which edition* of an album a release is, in words a human can read.

This exists because the library could not hold two editions of the same album. The organizer
filed everything as `{artist}/{album} ({year})/`, so the standard and deluxe "The Slow Rush
(2020)" resolved to byte-identical paths - and since execute_plan refuses to overwrite, the
second one you downloaded was skipped file by file and never arrived. That is the same
complaint that made Lidarr unusable here, so it is worth solving properly rather than by
appending a counter.

Two ideas keep it honest:

  resolve_edition_label()  - the human-readable name of this edition, from whatever the
                             release actually told us. Deliberately allowed to be empty:
                             most albums have exactly one edition and should just be
                             `Album (Year)` with no noise bolted on.
  edition_discriminator()  - the tiebreaker used ONLY when two genuinely different releases
                             would still collide. Ugly but unique, and never reached for
                             unless it is needed.

Both are pure functions over the release dict that is already stored with each job, so the
folder a release maps to is stable forever and can be recomputed without a network call.

`edition_label` on the release is an explicit override that wins over everything else. It is
the hook for the metadata manager: once you can pick which edition an album really is, that
choice is written there and everything downstream follows it without this module changing.

    A short human-readable name for this edition, or '' when there is nothing to say.

    Order matters. Each source is tried only when the ones above it gave nothing:

      1. `edition_label`    an explicit choice. The metadata-manager hook; always wins.
      2. `disambiguation`   MusicBrainz's own edition descriptor, and by far the best source -
                            it is literally the field editors use to tell releases apart
                            ("deluxe edition", "2011 remaster", "Japanese edition").
      3. `edition_tags`     detected from the title/disambiguation by the UI. Coarser, but
                            present for releases whose disambiguation is empty.
      4. format            only when it is not a plain CD/digital - a vinyl pressing beside a
                            CD is a real distinction worth seeing.
      5. country           regional pressings, when nothing above distinguished them -
                            ONLY with `with_country`, which COUNTRY_IN_FOLDER turns on. Off by
