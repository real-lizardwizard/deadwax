"""
The settings tab's backend.

MOST SETTINGS ARE EDITABLE HERE. The ones that aren't, aren't for a stated reason.

Server settings arrive as environment variables from a compose `environment:` block or from
`.env`, read once at process start. Editing that file from inside the container would not
affect the running process, so the writable path does NOT touch it. Overrides are stored in
the sqlite database instead (see the `settings` table in store.py) and laid over the
environment's values at startup by Config.apply_overrides().

The precedence question is the one that matters, and there is only one honest answer:

  A STORED OVERRIDE WINS over the environment.

The alternative - environment wins - would mean an edit made in this tab silently reverted on
the next restart for anybody configuring through compose, which is most people. So the
override wins, and the tab says plainly when a value is overriding what the environment
supplied, and offers to revert it. Reverting DELETES the row rather than writing the
environment's value back, so a setting that has been reverted follows the compose file again
instead of pinning whatever it happened to say that day.

Two settings genuinely cannot be edited here, and the tab renders the reason rather than
hiding them: DB_PATH (it is the database the overrides live in) and PUID/PGID (consumed by
docker-entrypoint.sh, which has already dropped privileges before Python starts).

Editing applies LIVE, without a restart, because Config is read as a class attribute at the
point of use rather than captured at import. The two cached clients are the exception, so a
change to their settings drops the cached client and the next call rebuilds it.

Diagnosis is still half the job. For every setting the tab answers:

  1. what value did the container actually receive?
  2. which file do I go and edit to change it - or is it overridden here?
  3. is it usable, and if not, precisely what is wrong with it?

Question 2 is genuinely hard to answer from outside: once load_dotenv() has run, a value from
compose and a value from .env are indistinguishable in os.environ. config.py captures the
difference at import time; this endpoint is what surfaces it.

Client-side preferences (format preference, auto-grab, candidate defaults) are a separate
thing entirely - they live in localStorage, they ARE editable, and the backend never sees
them. See ui/src/state/persisted.ts.

      Definitionally wrong is rejected. An ORGANIZE_MODE of "sideways" or a URL with no
      scheme can never work, whatever else changes, so storing it would only produce a
      confusing failure later somewhere less informative.

      Environmentally wrong is STORED and reported. A path that doesn't resolve today may be
      a volume the user is about to mount, and refusing it would mean the only way to fix a
      broken setup is to edit the compose file - which is exactly what this tab exists to
      avoid. The row renders its own validation state, so nothing is hidden by allowing it.
