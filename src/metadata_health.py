"""
Which albums still need their metadata seen to, and why.

The library view could tell you what you have. It could not tell you what was *wrong* with
what you have - so finding the album that arrived with no MusicBrainz id, or the one still
filed under its pressing's year rather than the album's, meant opening the editor on every
album in turn and reading its current-state line. That is the same "open it and check"
busywork that made Lidarr's release picker useless, reproduced inside deadwax.

Everything here is a pure function over the album dicts library.py already produces. No
filesystem, no MusicBrainz, so the whole rule set is testable from fixtures - the same reason
matching.py and editions.py are pure.

Three rules keep this honest:

  **An issue names something a human can fix, and says how.** `no_release` is actionable:
  open the editor, pick the release. A vague "this looks wrong" is not, and a queue full of
  those is a queue you learn to ignore.

  **An issue is derived, never stored.** The only thing persisted about an album is that you
  chose to IGNORE it (store.py::album_review). A fixed album therefore leaves the queue on
  its own the next time it is scanned, rather than waiting for something to remember to
  unmark it - which is the failure mode of every "needs attention" flag that is written down.

  **Severity orders the queue, it does not hide anything.** An album with no release id has
  five other issues downstream of that one fact; they are all reported, because suppressing
  them would mean the count changes as you fix things in a way that looks like new problems
  appearing.
