    Recently fetched MusicBrainz responses, keyed on the request that produced them.

    Worth having because the questions repeat far more than they change. Opening the metadata
    editor asks for a release-group search and then the releases of the best few groups; the
    first group's releases are ALSO fetched by fully_search as `best-match-releases`, so that
    one was fetched twice every single time. Stepping through the review queue and back asks the
    same questions again, and MusicBrainz is rate limited to roughly one request a second - so
    every avoided request is a second of someone waiting.

    The data is nearly static. A release group's pressings do not change while you are looking
    at them, so a stale answer is not a real risk on this timescale.

    Bounded rather than unbounded: a release list with recordings included is a large payload
    (the Black Album's group runs to hundreds of releases), and a long-running container asking
    about a big library would otherwise hold every one it had ever seen.

    **Only successful responses are ever stored** - see request_with_retries. It returns an
    error dict rather than raising when it gives up, and caching that would pin a transient
    MusicBrainz outage in place for the whole TTL, turning a bad minute into a bad hour.

        Every release group credited to an artist, in full.

        THIS IS A BROWSE, NOT A SEARCH, and that distinction is the entire point of the
        endpoint. A search answers in relevance order and spends its limit on whatever matches,
        so "the 50 best matches for Portishead, sorted by year" is the oldest of the fifty most
        relevant - not the artist's earliest work. A browse asks for everything credited to one
        artist id and pages until it has it, which is the only way a chronological discography
        can be honest about being complete.

        `primary_types` filters server-side (album, ep, single, broadcast, other). Filtering
        here rather than after the fact matters for the same reason it does in the search
        query: the cap below is spent on what was asked for instead of on singles nobody
        wanted.

        `studio_only` drops live albums, compilations and the rest AFTER the browse, because
        MusicBrainz browse has no secondary-type parameter. Filtering returned rows is exactly
        what CLAUDE.md says not to do for the SEARCH - but the reason it is wrong there does
        not apply here. A search spends a limited budget on whatever matched, so discarding
        rows throws that budget away; a browse has already paged through everything credited
        to the artist, so what is being filtered is the complete set rather than a sample.
