        Make the browser revalidate the interface files instead of trusting its cache.

        Without this, updating the container leaves people staring at the old CSS and JS

        changed", which is miserable to diagnose. `no-cache` still allows a conditional
        request, so with StaticFiles' ETags the normal case is a cheap 304 rather than a
        re-download. It cost real time during development before being noticed here.

        The hashed-asset carve-out matters as the Preact migration lands: matching only
        /scripts/ and /styles/ would have left the new bundle uncovered and reintroduced that
        exact bug for the half of the interface that had been ported.
